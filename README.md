# FREEDOM

**Freedom** is a path tracer, I am adding features actively to it to make it a good renderer.
This project is started with studying and learning from great resource of https://raytracing.github.io/ by **Peter Shirely** and is growing by studying Computer Graphics Programming and techniques from other resources like https://pbrt.org/

Features like Real-Time rendering and some fancy UIs and other cool features will be added to it.
